Oak: a tiny and almost abstract Haskell widget set
-----------------------------------------------------------------

With Oak you can declare the application's UI and set up event
handlers. Then the UI can be rendered and run using a concrete
frontend (i.e., SDL).

Current functionality:
 - layout support;
 - focus handling;
 - event loop;
 - window stacks;
 - modal dialogs via call/answer.

The example application built with Oak is Jewelry game:

  http://github.com/dmatveev/jewelry

Depends on the "mutators" package:

  http://github.com/dmatveev/mutators

Installation:

  runhaskell Setup.hs configure
  runhaskell Setup.hs build
  runhaskell Setup.hs install
